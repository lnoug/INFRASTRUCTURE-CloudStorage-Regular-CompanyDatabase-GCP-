# 1. Create a new project & enable necessary APIs
Create a new GCP project using the Google Cloud Console or the gcloud command-line tool and Enable the required APIs 

CODE:

Output:
The output of this step will be a new GCP project with the specified project ID, name, and labels.


# 2. Set up a Development Environment

Now that we have our project set up, we need to get our computer ready to start writing code. 
We need to install tools and libraries that will help us make our web application.
In this case, we will use Python (pip) and Flask to make our web application work.
We'll also install some extra tools like CLoud Storage, Pub/Sub to help us store and process data securely and efficiently.

CODE:

pip install flask google-cloud-storage google-cloud-pubsub

Output:
The output of this step will be the installation of Flask, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub libraries on your computer.
