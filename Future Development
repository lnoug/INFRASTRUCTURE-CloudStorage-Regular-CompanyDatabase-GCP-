There are several potential future developments that could be implemented for the infrastructure. 
Here are a few possibilities:
1. Add authentication and authorization: Currently, anyone who has access to the web application can upload data to the Cloud Storage bucket. Adding authentication and authorization would allow you to control who has access to the web application and what they are allowed to do.
2. Improve error handling and logging: The current infrastructure doesn't have comprehensive error handling or logging. Adding more robust error handling and logging would make it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues with the web application.
3. Integrate with other GCP services: There are many other services offered by GCP that could be integrated with the web application. For example, you could use Cloud Functions to process data as it is uploaded to the Cloud Storage bucket, or use Cloud Run to run the web application in a containerized environment.
4. Scale the infrastructure: If the web application becomes very popular or needs to handle large amounts of data, you may need to scale the infrastructure to handle the increased traffic. This could involve using GCP's autoscaling features or implementing a load balancer.
5. Implement version control: Version control can help you keep track of changes to your code and infrastructure over time, making it easier to roll back changes or collaborate with other developers. You could use a tool like Git to implement version control for your code.
6. Implement a database: Currently, the web application doesn't store any data about the files that are uploaded. Adding a database, such as Google Cloud SQL or Google Cloud Firestore, would allow you to store metadata about the files and make it easier to search and retrieve data.
7. Add automated testing: Automated testing can help you catch issues with your code before they make it into production. You could use a tool like Selenium or Pytest to create automated tests for your web application.
8. Implement a CDN: A content delivery network (CDN) can improve the performance and reliability of your web application by caching content closer to the end user. You could use a tool like Google Cloud CDN to implement a CDN for your web application.
9. Add monitoring and alerting: Monitoring and alerting can help you identify issues with your infrastructure in real-time. You could use a tool like Google Cloud Monitoring or Stackdriver to monitor your infrastructure and send alerts when issues are detected.
10. Use machine learning: If your web application involves processing or analyzing data, you could use machine learning to automate some of the processes. For example, you could use Google Cloud AutoML to train a model to classify images or texts.
11. Implement CI/CD: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) can help you automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your code. You could use a tool like Google Cloud Build or Jenkins to implement CI/CD for your web application.
12. Add support for multiple file formats: Currently, the web application only supports a single file format for uploads. You could add support for additional file formats, such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
13. Implement a search functionality: If your web application involves storing a large amount of data, you could implement a search functionality using a tool like Elasticsearch or Google Cloud Search.
14. Add support for multiple languages: If your web application is used by a global audience, you could add support for multiple languages using a tool like Google Cloud Translate.
15. Implement a recommendation engine: If your web application involves recommending products or content to users, you could implement a recommendation engine using a tool like Google Cloud AI Platform.
16. Add real-time messaging: If your web application involves real-time interactions between users, you could add real-time messaging using a tool like Google Cloud Pub/Sub or Firebase Cloud Messaging.
17. Implement a content management system: If your web application involves managing a large amount of content, you could implement a content management system (CMS) using a tool like WordPress or Drupal.
18. Add support for mobile devices: If your web application needs to be accessible on mobile devices, you could add support for mobile devices using a tool like Google Firebase or Apache Cordova.
