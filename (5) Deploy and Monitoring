#8: Deploy and Monitor the Application

Now that we've updated our web application to use Cloud Storage and Cloud Pub/Sub, we're ready to put it on the internet for everyone to use. We'll use the same tool we used earlier, Google Cloud Functions, to deploy our web application and make it available for people to use. We'll also use Stackdriver to monitor our web application and make sure everything is working the way it should.
To deploy and monitor the application, you can use the Cloud Console or other monitoring tools like Stackdriver.

CODE:

gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --entry-point=upload --runtime=python38 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars BUCKET_NAME=BUCKET_NAME,TOPIC_NAME=TOPIC_NAME

Output:
The output of this step will be the deployed and monitored web application on GCP, ready to use.
