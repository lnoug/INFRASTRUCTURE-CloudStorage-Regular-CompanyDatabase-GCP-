# INTRO
 we will build a simple web application that allows companies to securely upload and store their data in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
 We will use Google Cloud Functions to process the data and Google Cloud Pub/Sub to send notifications when new data is uploaded. 
 

#SUMMARIZE

1. Create a project
2. Set up a development environment
3. Write code
4. Test the application locally
5. Deploy the application to Google Cloud Functions
6. Set up a Cloud Storage bucket
7. Update the application to use Cloud Storage and Cloud Pub/Sub
8. Deploy and monitor the application

#Simplify


1. Create a new project on GCP.
2. Install some special tools on your computer to write code for the web application.
3. Write code that tells the web application what to do when someone visits or uploads data.
4. Test the web application on your own computer to make sure it works.
5. Put the web application on the internet using a tool called Google Cloud Functions.
6. Create a special place to store all the data people upload using Google Cloud Storage.
7. Update the web application's code to use Google Cloud Storage to store data and Cloud Pub/Sub to send notifications when someone uploads new data.
8. Deploy the updated web application and monitor it using Stackdriver to make sure everything is working correctly.
